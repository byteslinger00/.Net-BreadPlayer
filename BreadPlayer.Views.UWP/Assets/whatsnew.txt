First of all, sorry for the loooong delay in releasing this. I got immensely busy and still am so I don't think any big release after this will be coming anytime soon. I am extremely sorry though. Thank you everyone for your support. Here's something to keep you occupied.
What's Fixed:
I fixed all the bugs I could find and were reported to me by you guys. Some of which (the major ones) are:
1. Fixed the next/previous song button (annoying bug)
2. Fixed OneDrive integration
3. Fixed Last.fm support
4. Fixed crashes when going to now playing screen
5. Fixed many other minor pesky bugs.

What's improved:
1. I tweaked the album list UI a bit.

What's bad:
1. Sorry guys, I had to remove support for Windows Mobile. Couldn't improve/fix things without it.

Some other news:
* If any of you guys have switched to or use Android I have shifted there and I will start the development of all my apps (2 in number) there very soon. In fact, HandBook is already under development.
I go by the name of "thecodrr" there so I hope to see some of you guys there! :D
